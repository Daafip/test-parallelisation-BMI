# Test parallelisation BMI

This repository contains a BMI model which just sleeps: idea is to test parallelisation in eWatercycle with it. 

Uses the [Basic Model Interface (BMI)](https://bmi.readthedocs.io/).

The goal is to plug this model into [eWaterCycle](https://ewatercycle.readthedocs.io/).
